# React Bootcamp

1. A JS Library for building User Interfaces
   - Components are used to build User Interfaces
   - Think of components as custom html elements
1. [Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/)
1. Why React?
   - UI State becomes difficult to handle w/ vanilla JS
   - Focus on business logic, not on preventing app from exploding
   - Huge ecosystem, active community, high performance
1. React Alternatives
   - Angular
   - Vue
   - Backbone
   - Ember

## Single Page Applications vs Multi-Page Applications

1. SPA
   - Only ONE HTML page, content is (re)rendered on Client
   - Page is built of components, each a react component
   - One ReactDOM.render() call
1. MPA
   - Multiple HTML page, content rendered on server
   - React would be used to create 'widgets'
   - Multiple ReactDOM.render calls since we'd have multiple 'widgets'

## Build Workflow

1. Dependency Manager
   - npm
1. Bundler
   - Webpack
1. Compiler (Next-Gen JS)
   - Babel + Presets
   - Hooked into Webpack
1. Use Development Server
